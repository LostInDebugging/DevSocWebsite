                    Hi! I'm Dev. I am a third year Computer Science student studying at UNSW. It is my first time creating a website so I just ended up using
                    HTML, CSS and Java. It took some time to get used to these languages, especially after having worked with "actual" programming languages 
                    for so long. But it was a great learning experience!
                </p>

                <p id = "courses">
                    COMP Courses I've taken so far: COMP1511, COMP1521, COMP1531, COMP2511, COMP2521, COMP3311 <br />
                    COMP Courses I'll be taking this term: COMP2041, COMP3231, COMP3331
                </p>

                <p id = "projects">
                    No projects here :( <br /> <br /> But you can change that by picking me for trainee :D
                </p>

                <P id = "theme">
                    Ok I realise that just colour choice may not be enough for following the "Opposites Attract" theme.
                    So I will give my own opinion on what I think about the theme. <br /> <br />
                    I think that the saying is indeed true. We as humans tend to look for attributes or traits that we do not possess.
                    And as such, when we find something that exists outside of us that may potentially be opposite in nature to some 
                    attribute of ours, we are inherently attracted to it. After all life would be boring if everyone thought, acted 
                    and behaved the same way!
                </P>
